# AIRBNB-Clone
![AirBnB](https://github.com/KuriaDan/AirBnB_clone/blob/master/img/airbnb.png)
## Description
This project is part of ALX Software Engineering program
It's the first step towards building a full web application, an AirBnB clone.
It consists of custom CLI for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data

## Usage

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

Command | Example
------- | -------
Run the console | ```./console.py```
Quit the console | ```(hbnb) quit```
Display the help for a command | ```(hbnb) help <command>```
Create an object (prints its id)| ```(hbnb) create <class>```
Show an object | ```(hbnb) show <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)```
Destroy an object | ```(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)```
Show all objects, or all instances of a class | ```(hbnb) all``` or ```(hbnb) all <class>```
Update an attribute of an object | ```(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"``` or ```(hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>")```

Non-interactive mode example

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
```
## File storage

The folder [engine](./models/engine/) manages the serialization and deserialization of all the data, following a JSON format.

A FileStorage class is defined in [file_storage.py](./models/engine/file_storage.py) with methods to follow this flow:
```<object> -> to_dict() -> <dictionary> -> JSON dump -> <json string> -> FILE -> <json string> -> JSON load -> <dictionary> -> <object>```

The [__init__.py](./models/__init__.py) file contains the instantiation of the FileStorage class called **storage**, followed by a call to the method reload() on that instance.
This allows the storage to be reloaded automatically at initialization, which recovers the serialized data.

## Tests

All the code is tested with the **unittest** module.
The test for the classes are in the [test_models](./tests/test_models/) folder.
